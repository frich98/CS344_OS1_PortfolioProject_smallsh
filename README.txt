---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To create the executable for Assignment 3, smallsh, 
on OSU's ENGR server OS1 in any given directory
where you have placed the zipped files
(5 code files + 1 makefile, listed below),
type the following on the command line: make

This will produce an .exe file called "smallsh" , per the assignment instructions

To run the executable, type the following on the command line: ./smallsh.

All of the interactions for this program happen on the command line.
There are no file inputs like their were for Assignment 1. 

To clean your environment, which will only remove the smallsh exe file, 
type on the command line: make clean.
